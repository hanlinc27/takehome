# 📝 Hanlin C. Quiz App

For my Exponent take home quiz app I used React with functional components, React router, axios for data fetching on the endpoints, and react hooks for state validation.

### 🎨 Styling
I mocked up the designs inside of Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/q9GA5NYJ7hxiKCIP8xxKnj/Exponent-Take-Home?node-id=2%3A0
<br/>
The pages were styled with styled components (https://styled-components.com/) and Material UI (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material-ui/core)

### 🖥 Development 
All my code is on the `develop` branch. 
It can be run by the commands: 
```
npm install
```
and then run 
```
npm start
```
